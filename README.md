## 🎨 Syntax

Layx introduces intuitive syntax for common layout elements:

### Container

```html
<container>
   <div class='content'></div>
</container>
```

### Main Layout System

```html
<layout>
  <div class='x-6'></div>
  <div class='x-6'></div>
</layout>
```

### Components (e.g., Navbar)

```html
<navbar>
  <nav class='link-wrapper'>
    <a class='link' href='#'>link</a>
    <a class='link' href='#'>link</a>
  </nav>
</navbar>
```
